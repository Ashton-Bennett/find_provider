# Built with React, Typescript, Tailwind, and tested with Jest.

# Find Providers was built for the IntelliProcessing platform. It will allow users to quickly find a drug testing provider. Without leaving the platform the user is able to find top rated providers in their area. At the click of a button the user is able to call, get directions and view the provider's website.

# The application will get the users current location using the geo location api. Then provide all the top rated drug testing providers within 9 miles of that location. Each provider will be displayed on a card component that will include details such as phone number, address, and links to get directions.

# This was a fun project it was my first time using Tailwind CSS. It was really easy to learn and I cant wait to get access to their component library. Tailwind will be a tool I reach for in the future.

# Using the Google api on a front end only app was more difficult than I thought it would be. Their documentation for calling the api with React was'nt very concise and I found myself having to look else where for answers to my questions.
